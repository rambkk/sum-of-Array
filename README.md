There are several ways to get corresponding sum of arrays.

## To sum arrays, some points to be thought of:
1) Same structure: What to do with the extra item?
2) Different structure: What to do when this happens?

The correct answer depends on the objective of the program.  
(NOTE: there could be other answers)

Let's start.
```
(X being something to indicate a problem eg. null, undefined, some custom data, etc.)
```



## One dimension array
`[1,2,3]` and `[2,3,4]` -- sum = `[3,5,7]` 


With extra item:
`[1,2,3]` and `[2,3,4,9]` -- OR -- `[1,2,3,9]` and `[2,3,4]` -- both can be  
a) `[3,5,7]`   
b) `[3,5,7,9]`  
c) `[3,5,7,X]`  


## Multi dimension array
`[1,[2,3],4]` and `[2,[3,4],5]` -- sum = `[3,[5,7],9]`  
  
With extra item  
`[1,[2,3]]` and `[2,[3,4],9]` -- OR -- `[1,[2,3],9]` and `[2,[3,4]]` -- both can be  
a) `[1,[5,7]]`  
b) `[1,[5,7],9]`  
c) `[1,[5,7],X]`  
  
(Similar to above)  
  
Now, what if there are differences between the structure of the two arrays.  
`[1,[2,3],4]` and `[2,[3,4],[5,6]]`  
  
This can be:  
a) `[1,[5,7],4]`  
b) `[1,[5,7],[5,6]]`  
c) `[1,[5,7],X]`
