There are several ways to get corresponding sum of arrays.\
Adding respective numbers in arrays.\
Adding arrays or adding two arrays.\
Summing arrays.

## To sum arrays, some points to be thought of:
1) Same structure: What to do with the extra item?
2) Different structure: What to do when this happens?
3) What to do with empty array item?

The correct answer depends on the objective of the program.  
(NOTE: there could be other answers)

Let's start.
```
(X being something to indicate a problem eg. null, false, some custom data, etc.)
```



## One dimension array
`[1,2,3]` and `[2,3,4]` -- sum = `[3,5,7]` 


With extra item:
`[1,2,3]` and `[2,3,4,9]` -- OR -- `[1,2,3,9]` and `[2,3,4]` -- both can be  
a) `[3,5,7]`   
b) `[3,5,7,9]`  
c) `[3,5,7,X]`  


## Multi dimension array
`[1,[2,3],4]` and `[2,[3,4],5]` -- sum = `[3,[5,7],9]`  
  
With extra item  
`[1,[2,3]]` and `[2,[3,4],9]` -- OR -- `[1,[2,3],9]` and `[2,[3,4]]` -- both can be  
a) `[3,[5,7]]`  
b) `[3,[5,7],9]`  
c) `[3,[5,7],X]`  
  
(Similar to above)  
  
Now, what if there are differences between the structure of the two arrays.  
`[1,[2,3],4]` and `[2,[3,4],[5,6]]`  
  
This can be:  
a) `[3,[5,7],4]`  
b) `[3,[5,7],[5,6]]`  
c) `[3,[5,7],X]`  

What to do when summing a blank item (array with hole) to a number or empty array to empty array?\
... something to think further
`[3,   ,[4],5,[]]` and `[2,7,5,5]`    sum =  `[5,7  ,X,10,[]]`
`[3,[9],[4],[],5]` and `[2, ,[5],[]]` sum =  `[5,[9],[9],[],5]`



Examples in Javascript are in the files in this project with all the above approaches, mostly using `null` for
flagging difference in the structures. The functions use several methods including map, reduce, shift, etc. for
adding corresponding numbers. There are some which abuses 'reduce' ðŸ¤­. 

'undefined' has to be handled with care and it's not supported by JSON (EMCA-404)

There are also some pure recursion in the Javascript example, making use of purely recursive calls without any iteration.\
These are fun ðŸ™ƒ
